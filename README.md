# Help

I have a `.png` file that serves as the logo for the project, but I have no idea how to apply it to the actual app. If anyone knows and is willing to add it, thank you very much!

# Installation (From Source)

I have already created a `.dmg` and a `.exe` file in the releases, but if you want to build it yourself or use a different operating system, you can run the following commands:

```
npm install (to install dependencies)
npm run build:(the file extension you want)
```

This will generate the file in the `dist` folder.

**NOTE:** You need to have `node` and `npm` installed, and you will need to update the `package.json` file accordingly.

## Clean Build

Run this to clean temporary files:

```
./clean.sh
```

## Requirements
- Node.js
- npm
